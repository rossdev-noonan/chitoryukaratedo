# Chito-Ryu International — Full Sitemap & App Router Structure

**Domain:** chitoryukaratedo.com · **Build lead:** Ross · **SEO:** Adrian · **UI/UX:** Gil
**Source reconciled from:** build-procedure `.md`, developer build doc (PDF), Mike approval doc (PDF)

---

## 0. Reconciliation notes (read this first)

The three source documents don't fully agree on route shape. This document takes the **build-procedure `.md`** as the source of truth (it's the operating spec for the coding agent), and resolves the conflicts as follows:

| Conflict        | Approval doc (Mike-facing) said    | Build procedure / tech doc said                                                                        | Used here                                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Dojo detail URL | `/dojo-directory/[country]/[dojo]` | `/dojo/[slug]`                                                                                         | `/dojo/[slug]` (flat, unique slug)                    |
| Rules page      | separate `/rules`                  | folded into `/resources/*`                                                                             | `/resources/soke-cup-rules`, `/resources/bogu-kumite` |
| News detail     | `/news/[article]`                  | `/news/[slug]`                                                                                         | `/news/[slug]`                                        |
| Locale routes   | not mentioned                      | `/en/*`, `/ja/*`, `/de/*`, `/fr/*` listed in tech doc route plan, but **not** in Phase 1–8 build tasks | **Deferred** — see note below                         |

**On locale routes:** the tech doc lists `/en/*`, `/ja/*`, `/de/*`, `/fr/*` in the route plan table, but no phase in the build procedure actually implements them, and Phase 6 explicitly says _"Add hreflang only where translations are approved."_ Recommendation: do **not** build locale sub-routing in v1. Structure content in Sanity so locale support can be added later (e.g. via `[locale]` segment) without a route rewrite. Flag this to Mike as an open decision, not an assumption.

**Non-negotiables carried through this sitemap** (from build-procedure): no shop/payments/video/paid portal in v1, no n8n, no country/dojo self-publishing, no public rank evidence.

**New finding — hub-and-spoke country model (added after researching Canada/US federation sites):**
ICKF Canada (`ickf.ca`) and USA-ICKF (`usa-ickf.com`) already run their own independently maintained federation sites with their own dojo listings ("Members" / "Locations" pages, grouped by province/state). Re-hosting full dojo records for these countries in Supabase would duplicate a source of truth that already has a live, local owner — the same problem the build spec already bans between Sanity and Supabase, just one level up. Recommended model:

- **Countries with their own standing federation site** (confirmed cases so far: Canada, USA) → country page shows a **federation card** (flag, federation name, country representative, short description) plus an outbound link to their official site. No full dojo grid hosted here.
- **Countries without their own federation site** → country page hosts the full approved dojo directory, as originally wireframed.

This needs one small addition to the Phase 3 data model on the `countries` table:

```
has_own_federation_site: boolean
federation_site_url: string | null
```

`/dojo-directory/[country]/page.tsx` branches its render on this flag. **Open item:** Mike needs to confirm the full list of countries that already run their own ICKF-affiliated federation site before this is locked — do not infer this from search results, since several countries (notably Canada and the US) have unaffiliated organizations using near-identical Chito-Ryu names that are _not_ part of ICKF/Soke's lineage. Country/dojo source data must come from Mike/Sohonbu directly, not from general web research.

## 5. Role → Route Access Matrix

| Route group                  | Public | Teacher                    | Dojo Admin    | Country Admin    | Sohonbu Admin |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| Public pages                 | ✅     | ✅                         | ✅            | ✅               | ✅            |
| `/admin/dojos` (submit)      | ❌     | ❌                         | own dojo only | own country only | ✅            |
| `/admin/teachers` (submit)   | ❌     | own profile (request only) | own dojo only | own country only | ✅            |
| `/admin/approvals` (approve) | ❌     | ❌                         | ❌            | ❌               | ✅ only       |
| `/admin/users`               | ❌     | ❌                         | ❌            | ❌               | ✅ only       |
| `/admin/settings`            | ❌     | ❌                         | ❌            | ❌               | ✅ only       |

Enforcement is **server-side** (middleware + per-request role/scope check) backed by Supabase RLS — never client-side only, per non-negotiables.

**Why route groups:** `(public)` and `(auth)` share the App Router's ability to apply different layouts without changing the URL. `admin` is a real folder (not a group) because `/admin` must appear in the actual URL and is where `middleware.ts` applies its guard.

## 7. Data → Page Mapping (quick reference for Gil)

| Page              | Data source              | Notes for wireframe                                                                                                                            |

## 8. Research findings — existing ICKF-affiliated national sites

Checked ICKF Canada (`ickf.ca`) and USA-ICKF (`usa-ickf.com`) as real-world precedent, since they're the same federation lineage as this build (loyal to Soke/ICKF, not the unaffiliated splinter groups that share the Chito-Ryu name in both countries).

| Site         | Pattern observed                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ickf.ca      | Nav: Home, About, History, **Members**, Soke Cup, Gallery, Board, Events, Contact. Members page = pick a province, flat list per province (instructor, dojo, address, phone, email, site link). No search/filter/map. |
| usa-ickf.com | Nav includes **Locations** → state pages (NJ, FL, KY). Same flat pattern. Homepage centers lineage imagery (O-Sensei → 2nd Gen Soke → 3rd Gen Soke) above anything else.                                              |

Takeaways folded into this doc: (1) real federation sites use simple flat grouped lists, not heavy search/map UI — supports keeping Phase 3 scope lean; (2) lineage-first homepage is the established convention, not a stylistic choice — reinforces "Japan as center" for Home/Leadership; (3) hub-and-spoke model above, since both these countries already run their own directory.

## 9. Open items to confirm with Mike / Gil / Adrian before wireframe lock

- Which countries already have their own standing ICKF-affiliated federation site (confirmed so far: Canada, USA) — **must come from Mike, not web research**, since unaffiliated same-name organizations exist in both countries. Ross has since researched a fuller list of countries with confirmed/referenced ICKF ties and their primary language(s) — this is a starting point for Mike to confirm against, not itself the confirmation:

  | Country | Primary language(s) |
  | --- | --- |
  | Australia | English |
  | Canada | English (French in Quebec) |
  | Hong Kong | Cantonese, English |
  | Ireland | English (Irish also official) |
  | Jamaica | English |
  | Japan (Sohonbu) | Japanese |
  | Norway | Norwegian |
  | Scotland | English |
  | Singapore | English, Mandarin, Malay, Tamil |
  | United States | English |
  | UK | English |
  | Finland | Finnish, Swedish |

- Locale routing (`/en`, `/ja`, `/de`, `/fr`) — build now or defer? (Recommend: defer — 11 of the 13 countries above are English-primary or English-fluent for federation purposes, so English-only is a reasonable v1). If/when locale routing is built, note the current type system (`Noto Serif JP` + `Inter`, set 2026-07-10 for the homepage) only covers Latin + Japanese script — Cantonese/Mandarin, Tamil, and Bengali would need a separately-chosen CJK/Indic-capable font, not an assumption that the existing pairing already handles it.
- Map view vs list-only for Dojo Directory (approval doc says "map/list option if practical") — real precedent sites use list-only. The homepage's "Find a Dojo" section (built 2026-07-10) currently ships a static illustrative world-map image, not an interactive map — matches this recommendation for now.
- Whether admin login link sits in footer or is a fully hidden direct URL only — **resolved in the built homepage/footer**: it sits in the footer bottom bar, not in the main nav.
- **New, found while building the homepage:** the Figma dojo-listing card design includes a phone number, a longer per-dojo description, and a "Browse All N Locations" count — none of which exist in the current `dojos` schema (name, slug, city, head_instructor, contact_email, country only). Needs a decision: add these columns, or simplify the card design to match real data. See `handover-to-gil.md` Section 0 for the full note.
